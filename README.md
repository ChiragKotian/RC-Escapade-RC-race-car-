# RC-Escapade
We made an RC car for the event, RC-Escapade, conducted by the Robotics Club of our institute, Techmaniacs. Here is a brief description of it.

## Car Specifications:

## Race Track: 
![RAce track](https://github.com/ChiragKotian/RC-Escapade-RC-race-car-/assets/117931123/e83744fe-457b-4a6e-9eee-76aa8902e929)
This was the basic outline of the race track.


## Reverse mode:
In this car, we used a _brushless motor_ and _ESC_ used in **RC planes**; hence it has **_no_** reverse feature. Hence we devised our own **custom method** to do so. This method involves using _2 relays_ triggered by_ Arduino_ onboard connected to an_ RF receiver_ which interchanges _two wires_ of the brushless motor to run it in **reverse mode**. 

## Race:
Here is a **snippet from the Race**.

## Results:
In this competition, our team won the _**First Prize**_ by defeating all the teams in the races.
