# RC-Escapade
We made an RC car for the event, RC-Escapade, conducted by the Robotics Club of our institute, Techmaniacs. 

## Car's engineering aspect:
The major engineering constraint while making the car was the unavailability of professional RC race car components and a limited budget of Rs.15000. Hence, every part of the car had to be indigenously and salvaging some parts.

This car used was throttled by a _**DYS D3548-4 1100kv BLDC Motor**_ controlled by **_Readytosky 80A ESC 2-6S Brushless ESC Speed Controller_** controlled by the user via a **_Flysky FS-GT2 Transmitter via FS-GR3E Receiver_**. The motor was connected to the axle using **_a belt and pulley mechanism_**, which increased torque output due to a **_gear ratio of 1:3.75_**. The **_belt was always kept taut_** regardless of wear and tear by the **_auto tension mechanism designed and implemented by us_**. The car's steering used **_Ackerman steering_** made by us from metal plates, fasteners and plastic spacers powered by a **_TowerPro MG995 Plastic Gear Servo Motor_** with a torque of **_12kg-cm_**. The body of the car was divided into **_three sections_**, **_two lower sections_** supported by **_two suspensions_** each connected to the main chassis, one housing the **_steering mechanism_** and the other housing the **_traction_**. The last section was the **_top section_**, connected directly to the metal chassis housing the **_electronics_**.

## Race Track: 
![RAce track](https://github.com/ChiragKotian/RC-Escapade-RC-race-car-/assets/117931123/e83744fe-457b-4a6e-9eee-76aa8902e929)
This was the basic outline of the race track.


## Reverse mode:
In this car, we used a _brushless motor_ and _ESC_ used in **RC planes**; hence it has **_no_** reverse feature. Hence we devised our own **custom method** to do so. This method involves using _2 relays_ triggered by_ Arduino_ onboard connected to an_ RF receiver_ which interchanges _two wires_ of the brushless motor to run it in **reverse mode**. 

## Race:
Here is a **snippet from the Race**.

## Results:
In this competition, our team won the _**First Prize**_ by defeating all the teams in the races.
