# RC-Escapade
We made an RC car for the event, RC-Escapade, conducted by the Robotics club of our institute, Techmaniacs. Here is a brief description of it.

## Car Specifications:

## Race Track:

This was the basic outline of the race track.
You can see the video of the actual race track [here]().


## Reverse mode:
In this car, we used a _brushless motor_ and _ESC_ used in **RC planes**; hence it has **_no_** reverse feature. Hence we devised our own **custom method** to do so. This method involves using _2 relays_ triggered by_ Arduino_ onboard connected to an_ RF receiver_ which interchanges _two wires_ of the brushless motor to run it in **reverse mode**.
